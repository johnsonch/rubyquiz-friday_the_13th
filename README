This week's quiz is to locate all of the Fridays the 13th within an arbitrary
date range. Chris Johnson suggests that bonus points be awarded for calculating
the average time difference between successive Fridays the 13th. There are any
number of other statistics that could be derived (e.g., avg number of Fridays
the 13th per year) if you feel up to it.
